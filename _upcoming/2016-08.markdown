There'll be a short half-hour presentation on the history of Atomic OS and related improvements in web technology since the last release. The presentation will then be followed by an interactive session to discuss philosophical questions surrounding disruption, the meaning of "success" in the context of FOSS projects and whether "killer applications" for such projects are important.
