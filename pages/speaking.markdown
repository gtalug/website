### Meeting Facilities

The audience is typically 15-30 people in a classroom environment.  The room has:

  - A projector with VGA input.  Please try your laptop on an external monitor or projector before the meeting.
  - A whiteboard.
  - There's no lecturn, but there's a desk for you to rest your computer.

Note that there's no food or drink in the meeting space.  Bottled water is ok.

The meeting space is accessible, please let us know if you have any questions about the facilities.

We do not presently record meetings, and would not do so without your permission.  Please let us know ahead of time if you would like to bring recording equipment.  

### Need more stuff?

If your talk depends on specific tools, let us know!

For example:
  - Whiteboard markers
  - Internet access
  - HDMI video
  - Audio output

We can arrange these things ahead of time if we know.  


### On the day of the meeting

We recommend you arrive at 7pm to socialize and set yourself up.  Talk start time is 7:30pm.  

- The club membership will help you set up your projector and equipment.
- The president will cover any club business before the meeting, then introduce you and your talk.
- Let people know if you would like to save comments for the end.

The usual meeting end time is 9pm.  If your presentation is too long, 9:15 is our hard stop, but we'll warn you ahead of time.  If you run short, it leaves more time for questions or open discussion.

If you know your meeting time is going to run over or under, please let us know so we can prepare!


### After the meeting

The group usually heads to a neighbourhood pub after the meeting.  You're welcome to join us.
