### Discussion List

This is a general purpose list - for Linux announcements, technical questions, and other information. Subscribing to this list will automatically subscribe you to the Announce list.

This list is for the discussion of Linux related issues, news, problems, and ideas. This list is not anyone's personal soapbox. It is not for the discussion of political, social, or religious issues, bad jokes, personal rants or similar non Linux related discussion. Unsolicited commercial advertising will not be tolerated. Any subscribers who offers or requests pirated software, license keys or cracks, and similar will be dropped from the list without warning.

Off topic messages will not be tolerated or endorsed. First time offenders will be warned. Repeat offenders will be restricted from posting to the list for a one month period, or until such time that the list managers feel the offender is capable of following the rules.
