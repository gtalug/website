[OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/) is more than just a web mapping platform. It's a comprehensive, community-maintained map/geodatabase of the world that you can hack on. Since the last GTALUG talk on OSM over five years ago, it's grown a lot, and developed a huge community of mappers, developers and data users. In this talk, we'll discuss the basics of using OSM, how it survived a major licence change with only a little drama, and how it succeeds as a community.
