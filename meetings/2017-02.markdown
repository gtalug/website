Longtime GTALUG member and open source advocate Evan Leibovitch Has just returned from a two-year contract heading the Community Technology Access program of the United Nations refugee agency (UNHCR).

In this presentation Evan will discuss some of the challenges encountered in providing Internet connectivity and services to some of the world's most impoverished populations. Special emphasis will be given to the role of FOSS-based solutions and collaborative techniques in this unique realm of both technical and political problem-solving. Q&A to follow.
