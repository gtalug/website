Madison has been continuing to develop her 2-node, highly-available virtual machine platform for over four years. She has learned many important lessons on how to build a solid platform in that time.

This talk will cover a high-level introduction to HA clustering. It will go beyond the software stack, covering redundant and fault tolerant considerations at the network, power and monitoring layers. Anyone interested in building their own HA VM platform will be in a very good position to follow the associated tutorial.

Important lessons in designing nodes for hosting multiple virtual servers will also be discussed. How to avoid run-away seek latency is a critical part of virtualization platforms in general and may be helpful to anyone looking to setup virtualation, redundant or otherwise.
