#### Screen, Tmux, Byobu, the Secret Terminal Brains!!!
##### Christopher Browne

GNU Screen has been lurking around since the 1980s, as a kind of "tiling window manager atop curses".

BSD folk spawned an analogue called tmux in 2009, offering both additions and removals of functionality.

Byobu offers a harmonization, and (arguably) better user experience.

We'll look at some usages, use cases, and see how frequently Byobu Hollywood crashes.

#### Good Bye Boot Media! (or, don't copy that boot floopy)
##### Scott Sullivan

A tour of how network boot/install can save you ever having to burn a DVDs or USB drive.
