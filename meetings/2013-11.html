<p>The rise of the 3D printer has become a mantra of many in the main stream media. But what is often left undiscussed by these proponents is the critical software component to this hardware revolution. It is easy to see how the limitations of 3D printing software would not fit in this easily packaged narrative. This ignored aspect however creates unrealistic expectations for many 3D printing new comers. This presentation aims to correct these misconceptions with a grounded, pragmatic look at the state of open source CAD and CAM.

<p>In the first segment we will contrast the open source 3D CAD and CAM softwares available today. That will then be followed up with an in depth OpenSCAD programatic CAD tutorial.</p>
