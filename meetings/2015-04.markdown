### LessCSS

LessCSS extends the CSS language to make it actually useable by adding features like variables, mixins, functions, and a bunch of other techniques that allow you to make your stylesheets more maintainable, themeable, and extendible.

### Round Table Q&A Session

A Round Table Q&A Session is where we take questions from the audience, and the audience discusses and attempts to answer those questions from their own knowledge. It's a great way to meet fellow members of our community and discover the skill sets we each bring to the table.
