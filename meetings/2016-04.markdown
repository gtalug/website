### Panelists

#### Stewart Russell

Stewart Russell is a Linux user who should probably be kept away from admin, dev and other sharp objects. He draws mostly geometric patterns and enjoys unusual output devices such as pen plotters. He mostly works in Inkscape, but also finds graphical uses for Gimp, Darktable, QCAD, OpenSCAD, Processing, Perl, PostScript, Python, netpbm and — when all else fails — ink and gouache.

Some of his work is here: <https://www.flickr.com/photos/scruss/sets/72157666420609652/>

#### Trent Drake

Trent Drake is a freelance artist, with two decades experience in drawing anthropomorphic characters. A former qualitative data analyst, he continues to branch out in game design, animation, cartooning. He also directs and produces independent video productions for community organizations and YouTube.

He works in Windows, using Inkscape, GIMP, and Blender.

#### Myles Braithwaite

Myles Braithwaite is a web developer who sometimes has to designs user interfaces. He accomplishes this by using Open Source design tools like Inkscape for icons and wireframes, Dia for structure diagrams, and GNUpaint for rough sketching. He enjoys manipulating SVG files and manipulate them with Python and CSS (he was doing it before it was in vogue). On the rare occasion he has to interact with dead trees he uses Scribus to design page layouts.
