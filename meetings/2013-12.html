<p>GTALUG is a community of users and enthusiasts for Linux and Open Source. Many come out to hear and learn from our speakers each month, but we'd want to change things up this night. We want to hear from those in the audience about there experiances and interests. The format for this meeting will be a round table where we'll go around giving everyone an oppurtinity to say a bit about their passions, project or neat stories they have. It's a great chance to get to know your fellow GTALUG community members.</p>
