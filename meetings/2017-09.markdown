### xterms: State of Art 2017 with _Christopher Browne_

Many of us "live" in xterms, and there have been some developments.

This talk pokes a bit at:

-   The old, and what's still being developed
-   The new, and there ARE some interesting developments
-   A bit of the crazy!  Want an xterm that simulates shakey old amber monitors?  You got it!
