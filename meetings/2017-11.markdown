Building a 3D printer from scratch may be easier than making an apple pie from scratch! In this talk Alex will talk about getting into 3D printing 'the hard way' by building a clone of
Prusa i3 MK2 from scratch using bits of wood, some metric hardware, arduino, 3D-printer and 3D printed parts, then attempting to design and print.
