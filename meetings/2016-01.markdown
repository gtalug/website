We won't be covering i-a-h-j-k-l:wq, but instead looking at a variety of commands and plugins you may not be familiar with that can make your editor even better.  This will include a discussion of neovim, colours, dealing with your vimrc, mappings, buffers and tabs, sessions, plugins, VimScript, and possibly a couple other topics.
