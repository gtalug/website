A new architecture has arrived! 64-bit ARM promises high-performance, low-energy, extremely dense server computing systems. This is the first time in the history of computing that a major architecture has launched with Linux as the premier operating system. This talk will discuss the hard challenges presented by the Aarch64 architecture and the opportunities it creates.
